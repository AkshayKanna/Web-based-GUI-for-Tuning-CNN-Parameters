# Web-based-GUI-for-Tuning-CNN-Parameters

This is a web Based GUI developed for tuning the Convolution Neural Network Parameters

We can able to upload an Image dataset and choose the Required parameters 
Our System will train and Notify you with the Accuracy for the Parameters used for tuning

We also provide a option to download the Weight file and the Model file generated during tuning

Deployment  -  Django Web Server
Compiler  -  Python3
Deep learnig API  -  Keras using Tensorflow(with NVIDIA)
